# Netflix-data-analysis
A deep dive into Netflix’s library — data-driven insights on movies, shows, genres, and countries.
Netflix Data Analysis is a data science project exploring trends in Netflix’s global catalog of movies and TV shows. Using Python for data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory analysis, the project uncovers patterns in content production, release timelines, ratings, genres, and countries of origin.

The analysis answers questions such as:

How has Netflix’s content library evolved over the years?

Which countries and genres dominate the platform?

How do movie durations and TV show season counts vary?

What are the most common parental ratings?

This project demonstrates:

Data cleaning & preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing formats, extracting structured features from text.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Producing clear, publication-ready visualizations.

Reproducibility: Well-organized repository structure, environment files, and documented workflows so others can replicate the analysis.

Dataset: Netflix Movies and TV Shows (public dataset via Kaggle) https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook.
